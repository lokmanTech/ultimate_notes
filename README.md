# Programming Notes

A collection of notes and resources on learning Python, including code snippets, tutorials, and best practices. Ideal for beginners and enthusiasts to enhance their programming skills.

### Getting Started

Frankly speaking, I'm new to the programming world, coming from a completely different niche. But here I am, with one goal: making it easier for new learners!

### PYTHON

My goal is to become a **Data Architect**, and Python and SQL play significant roles in this field. However, in this context, the specific programming language doesn't matter much; the essence is the same— **PRACTICE**.

### 1.0 Familiarity with Functions, Reserved Keywords & Symbols

Familiarize yourself with functions, reserved keywords, and symbols to enhance your understanding of any programming code. In class, there is often a chapter-by-chapter syllabus, but different people have different learning methods.

For me, learning chapter by chapter sometimes makes me feel stuck, especially during programming tests. But, learning the common functions, keywords and symbols, does escalate my learning process.

Here are some common functions, keywords, and symbols:

#### Functions:
1. `print()`: Outputs a message to the console.
2. `input()`: Takes user input from the console.
3. `len()`: Returns the length of an object (e.g., string, list).
4. `range()`: Generates a sequence of numbers.
5. `type()`: Returns the type of an object.
6. `int()`: Converts a value to an integer.
7. `float()`: Converts a value to a floating-point number.
8. `str()`: Converts a value to a string.
9. `list()`: Creates a list.
10. `tuple()`: Creates a tuple.
11. `dict()`: Creates a dictionary.
12. `set()`: Creates a set.
13. `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
14. `sum()`: Returns the sum of elements in an iterable.
15. `max()`: Returns the maximum value in an iterable.
16. `min()`: Returns the minimum value in an iterable.
17. `sorted()`: Returns a sorted list of the specified iterable object.

20. `map()`: Applies a function to all items in an input list.

#### Reserved Keywords:
1. `False`: Represents the false value of the Boolean type.
2. `None`: Represents the absence of a value.
3. `True`: Represents the true value of the Boolean type.
4. `and`: A logical operator for boolean AND.
5. `as`: Used to create an alias while importing a module.

9. `continue`: Skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.
10. `def`: Used to define a new function.
11. `del`: Deletes objects.
12. `elif`: Used in conditional statements, same as else if.
13. `else`: Used in conditional statements.
14. `except`: Used with exceptions, what to do when an exception occurs.
15. `finally`: Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not.
16. `for`: Used to create a for loop.
17. `from`: Used to import specific parts of a module.
18. `global`: Declares a global variable.
19. `if`: Used to make a conditional statement.
20. `import`: Used to import a module.
21. `in`: Used to check if a value is present in a list, tuple, etc.
22. `is`: Used to test if two variables refer to the same object.
23. `lambda`: Used to create an anonymous function.
24. `nonlocal`: Declares a non-local variable.
25. `not`: A logical operator for boolean NOT.
26. `or`: A logical operator for boolean OR.
27. `pass`: A null statement, a statement that will do nothing.
28. `raise`: Raises an exception.
29. `return`: Exits a function and returns a value.
30. `try`: Used to make a try...except statement.
31. `while`: Used to create a while loop.
32. `with`: Used to simplify exception handling.
33. `yield`: Ends a function and returns a generator.

#### Symbols:
1. `+`: Addition operator.
2. `-`: Subtraction operator/negation operator.
3. `*`: Multiplication operator.
4. `/`: Division operator.
5. `%`: Modulus operator.
6. `**`: Exponentiation operator.
7. `//`: Floor division operator.
8. `=`: Assignment operator.
9. `==`: Equality comparison operator.
10. `!=`: Not equal comparison operator.
11. `<`: Less than comparison operator.
12. `>`: Greater than comparison operator.
13. `<=`: Less than or equal to comparison operator.
14. `>=`: Greater than or equal to comparison operator.
15. `+=`: Increment assignment operator.
16. `-=`: Decrement assignment operator.
17. `*=`: Multiplication assignment operator.
18. `/=`: Division assignment operator.
19. `//=`: Floor division assignment operator.
20. `%=`: Modulus assignment operator.
21. `**=`: Exponentiation assignment operator.
22. `&`: Bitwise AND operator.
23. `|`: Bitwise OR operator.
24. `^`: Bitwise XOR operator.
25. `~`: Bitwise NOT operator.
26. `<<`: Bitwise left shift operator.
27. `>>`: Bitwise right shift operator.
28. `and`: Logical AND operator.
29. `or`: Logical OR operator.
30. `not`: Logical NOT operator.
31. `is`: Identity operator.
32. `in`: Membership operator.
